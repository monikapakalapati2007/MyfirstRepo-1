GitHub is a proprietary, web-based platform that hosts Git repositories, providing a centralized location for developers to store, manage, and collaborate on their code and software projects.

It essentially builds a social and project management layer on top of Git, which is the underlying open-source version control system (VCS).

Key Functions and Features
For a student in B.Tech CSE (AIML), GitHub is essential because it allows for:

Version Control: It uses Git to track every single change (called a "commit") made to the project files over time. This acts like a digital time machine, allowing users to easily revert to previous, stable versions of the code if errors are introduced.

Collaboration: It enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work. This is managed through features like:

Branches: Parallel versions of the codebase where new features or bug fixes are developed independently.

Pull Requests (PRs): A mechanism to propose changes from a branch to the main codebase, allowing for code review, discussion, and quality control before the changes are merged.

Project Management: It provides integrated tools like Issues for tracking bugs, tasks, and enhancements, and Project Boards for organizing and prioritizing workflow.

Portfolio and Open Source: It serves as a professional portfolio for developers to showcase their coding skills, projects, and contributions to the world, particularly within the vast ecosystem of open-source software.
